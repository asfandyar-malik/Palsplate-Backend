Palsplate Concept Video [here](https://youtu.be/WLqcEZwD64E)


### Technology Stack:

* Java 8: primary language
* Maven 3: package manager
* Spring Boot 1.1.9.RELEASE: smart stand-alone application builder
* Jersey 2.7: RESTful Webservices package
* Hibernate 4: ORM (object relations mapper) framework. Mapps java objects to tables in SQL database
* PostgreSQL: Main Production Database

### @Annotations

We implemented Jersey with Spring for REST support using JAX-RS API. Although, Spring has pretty good REST support.

Hence you will see difference in Annotations like @PATH being used rather than @RequestMapping

### Populate Database:

Populate palsplate-demo database with some dummy data.

Use the following queries: 

```
INSERT INTO PERSON VALUES (1, 'asfandyar@gmail.com', 'Asfandyar', 'Malik', 'mypass', 'ROLE_USER,ROLE_ADMIN', '01575117434', 'islamabad', 'best chef ever', true)

INSERT INTO Customer VALUES (1, 1)

INSERT INTO Cook VALUES (1, 2)
INSERT INTO Cook VALUES (2, 3)

INSERT INTO FOOD VALUES(1, 'Biryani', '2011-05-16 15:36:38', '2011-06-16 15:36:38', 'Indian delight', 5, 3, 'vegetarian', 'Indian', 0.45, 0.56, true, 1)
INSERT INTO FOOD VALUES(2, 'Omlette', '2011-05-16 15:36:38', '2011-06-16 15:36:38', 'French delight', 5, 3, 'vegetarian', 'French', 0.45, 0.56, true, 1)
INSERT INTO FOOD VALUES(3, 'burger', '2011-05-16 15:36:38', '2011-06-16 15:36:38', 'fast food delight', 5, 3, 'meat', 'fast_food', 0.45, 0.56, true, 2)
```

- - - -
### QUERY DATABASE

Following is a query which finds out all persons/users who are cooks and currently have food offerings

```
select * 
from cook c
inner join person p on c.person_id = p.id
inner join food f on c.id = f.cook_id
where f.is_active = 't'
limit 10;
```

- - - -
### ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The code uses the following environment variables: 

* PALSPLATE_DB_URL
* MAILGUN_APIKEY
* CLOUDINARY_APIKEY
* CLOUDINARY_APISECRET
* PALSPLATE_DB_URL	
* PALSPLATE_EMAIL_TOKEN	

This value is equal to the db url from Heroku. 
(Remember that Heroku url is different from posgres url)

Heroku Postgres url: `postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname>`

Java Posgres url: `jdbc:postgresql://<host>:<port>/<dbname>?user=<username>&password=<password>`


- - - -
### Run Complete System

```
mvn clean package && mvn spring-boot:run
```
```
mvn clean package && java -jar target/palsplate-backend-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Go to: `localhost:8080/api/secure/products`


- - - -
### Security and Authorization

Authorization is provided by via spring security using the **oauth2.0** protocol. By design all the resources matching ``/api/secure/*`` are secured and require a login to retrieve.

There are 5 different grants to get access_token in oauth2, and in this project, `resource owner credentials grant` is being used. 

The authorization protocol follows the following mechanism.

1. Provide the username and password to retrieve the refresh token

`curl -u webclient:secret 'http://localhost:8080/oauth/token?username=admin&password=admin&grant_type=password'`

````{"access_token":"8789eae9-0863-4266-bff0-79e7799c910f","token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"73f29da8-57c5-4ae3-ac4d-59a061d6c05b","expires_in":1799,"scope":"read write"}````


2. Use the access token to retrieve the desired resource

 `curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer <access-token>" http://localhost:8080/api/secure/persons `


3. Provide the refresh token to the server to again retrieve the access token, if it gets expired

`curl -u webclient:secret 'http://localhost:8080/oauth/token?grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=<refresh-token>'  `

where <refresh-token> is received in the previous command

 ````{"access_token":"ef981a33-b431-44a9-86f3-ce4df31c6d5f","token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"73f29da8-57c5-4ae3-ac4d-59a061d6c05b","expires_in":1799,"scope":"read write"} ````

4. InOrder to receive currentUser information from token, use the following API:

 `GET http://localhost/api/secure/persons/currentuser`
